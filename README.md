# GitHub Codespaces ♥️ Django

Hi there in your shiny new Codespace running Django! We've got everything fired up and running for you to explore it.

You've got a blank canvas to work on from a git perspective as well. Everything is contained within this one codespace. 

There's a single initial commit with the default structure - the next steps are up to you!

Type "python manage.py runserver" in terminal to run the app
Use 'Publish Branch' to add GitHub repo and push the project
